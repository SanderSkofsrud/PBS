## Preface 

During the development of this program we have had our focus on one thing in particular, creating a positive experience for the user. With this as our goal, the development process has been motivated and driven by the idea of creating a clean, efficient and fast program.

To define clean, we would describe it as a program that shows you the information you need, and nothing more. Everything presented to the user has a purpose and a function. What we mean by efficient is that the program lets the user get what it needs done, quickly. The program is supposed to improve the life of the user, and because of that, we are trying to make the experience for the user as seamless and without hiccups as possible. The reason we want our program to be fast is so that the program works for the user, rather than the user having to work for the program. The user should not have to wait for the program, the program should always wait for the user. 

The reasons for our principles are clear. Our program comes as an addition to the regular use of a bank, and as such, we are not needed by the user. Our user should want to use it because they believe that the use of the program will improve their situation. And because of this, we want to be as least bothersome and as efficient as we possibly can.
